  ## 📘 Description of Project:

  
  Project was to create a team profile generator that prompts for information about your employees, and creates a index.html with the information provided. I built this project for a homework assignment in the UCF coding bootcamp. This application allows me to have much more time to complete the actual logic, instead of having to spend time on building a index.html. This project has helped me learn how to succesfully test my work, and allow me to create a html document from data from prompts.
  
  
  
  ## 🛠 Installation:

  
  Make sure you have node installed on your PC, then simply go to [My GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Hank5050?tab=repositories) and clone the project to your personal computer. 
  
  
  ## ✏ Usage:

  To test the application all you need to enter into the terminal is: npm test. To start the application, simply run the command: npm start. Answer the questions provided with all of the corresponding employees information. Once you have entered all employees needed, select the option to creat the HTML document. The application will then create a index.html file inside the dist folder, using the information you provided.
